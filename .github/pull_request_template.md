## Sorry, but...

I'm sorry you put the time and effort into creating this pull request, but I am
not currently accepting contributions to Psychopath, as explained in the
project's readme file.

You are more than welcome to fork Psychopath and play with it, or even develop
it independently into something of your own.  But this repo is, at least for
now, a one-man project.
