## Adapted code and data files

This crate includes code adapted from the supplemental material of the paper ["Physically Meaningful Rendering using Tristimulus Colours" by Meng et al.](https://cg.ivd.kit.edu/spectrum.php)  Specifically the code in `src/meng/`.  That code has no explicit license, but I contacted one of the authors and confirmed that it is intended to be used freely.  Take that for what you will!

This crate also includes data files from the supplemental material of the paper ["A Low-Dimensional Function Space for Efficient Spectral Upsampling" by Jakob et al.](https://rgl.epfl.ch/publications/Jakob2019Spectral).  Specifically, the files under `jakob_tables/`.  Please see LICENSE.txt in that directory for their license.
